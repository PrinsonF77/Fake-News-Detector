## Getting Started

The Project uses Machine Learning and 4 different Machine Learning models to predict whether news entered is fake or not. The models were trained using datasets with news up until the year 2017. Any real news entered after 2017 might get classified as FAKE! 

## Set Up

1) Make sure that you install the javafx SDK as the App.java file requires it.
2) Compile the App.java file using the command present in the runcmd.txt file.
3) In case the python code gives errors, rerun the whole python notebook present in the src directory and replace the files created by the python notebook with the ones already present in the models directory and you should be good to go.
